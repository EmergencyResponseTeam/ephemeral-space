# In addition to removing the destructible component & adding radiation resistance, this version of the airlock prototype removes device linking, the wires panel, associated guides to those things, AI control, electrocution, LightningTarget, and welding.
# It's kind of evil to just copy paste the entire YAML seperately instead of using inheritance for this, but there's not really much of a better way to do it, since we're a downstream.
# Either way of doing it is a merge conflict landmine, so let's just do this the easier way...
